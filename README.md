## So, what's the deal? 🤔

You use AI coding tools — Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, or honestly anything that talks to OpenAI or Anthropic. And you know the headaches: a drawer full of API keys, rate limits that hit at the worst time, and a token bill that keeps creeping up.

**KeiRouter is the smart middleman that makes all of that someone else's problem.** Point your tools at one local endpoint and let it handle the boring stuff — routing each request to the right model, failing over the moment a provider taps out, caching repeat questions, and squeezing oversized prompts down *before* they ever cost you a token.

Oh, and it's written in Go. So it sips memory (~20 MB), boots instantly, ships as a single binary, and comes with a dashboard that's actually nice to look at. ✨

> **Heads up:** KeiRouter is under active development. Peek at [Architecture](#-architecture) to see what's wired up today.

## ⭐ The good stuff

**Routing & reliability**
- 🔀 **One endpoint, every provider** — Your apps speak OpenAI or Anthropic; KeiRouter quietly translates to whatever you actually want to use.
- 🛡️ **Never stop coding** — Provider down? Rate limited? Fallback chains keep you moving like nothing happened.
- ⚡ **Semantic cache** — Ask the same thing twice and the embedding-powered cache hands it back instantly, for a glorious $0.00.

**Cost control**
- 💸 **Five token savers** — Two on the way in, three on the way out, all on a live savings dashboard. Details in [Token Savings](#-token-savings-where-the-money-hides).
- 💰 **Budget engine** — Per-key or per-org USD and token hard limits, with an auto-cutoff so surprise bills stay fictional.
- 🚦 **Rate limiting** — Per-key RPM, TPM, and concurrency caps via global defaults or reusable plans.
- 📋 **Plans & templates** — Set the rules once, slap them on any key.

**Safety & governance**
- 🛡️ **Guardrails** — PII, prompt-injection, toxicity, topics, and bias detectors layered global → provider → model → chain → key, with mid-stream output scanning and a fully-offline mode.
- 🔐 **Locked down by default** — AES-256-GCM envelope encryption for credentials, a password-gated dashboard, HMAC sessions, and SSRF protection on outbound calls.

**Operations & UX**
- 📊 **See everything** — Quota tracker, provider breakdowns, live key monitoring, TTFT metrics, and per-key summaries.
- 🎨 **White-label it** — Rebrand the dashboard and portal with your own name, logo, and palette.
- 🛠️ **Skills & CLI auto-config** — Built-in skills plus copy-paste configs for 12+ coding tools.
- 🌐 **Usage portal** — A no-admin-needed view so teammates can track their own usage and savings.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Grab whichever path matches what's already on your machine — no need to install things you won't use:

| Method | You'll need | Great for |
|---|---|---|
| **Homebrew** | macOS or Linux with Homebrew | The fastest way to a prebuilt binary |
| **Windows** | Windows 10/11 with PowerShell | Prebuilt binary, no Go/Node |
| **From source** | Go 1.24+ and Node.js 20+ | Local hacking / latest `main` |
| **Docker** | Just Docker | Clean, isolated runs |
| **Docker Compose** | Docker + Docker Compose | VPS / production / Coolify |

### Pick your install

<details open>
<summary><strong>Option A — Homebrew (macOS &amp; Linux)</strong> · the easy button</summary>

```bash
brew tap mydisha/keirouter https://github.com/mydisha/keirouter
brew install keirouter

keirouter -bootstrap   # mint your first API key (printed once — don't blink)
keirouter start        # fire up the server on :20180
keirouter tray         # or run in background with system tray icon
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option B — One-line from source</strong> · for the tinkerers</summary>

Needs **Go 1.24+** and **Node.js 20+**. No cloning, no `.env`, no config wrangling:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mydisha/keirouter/main/scripts/quickstart.sh | bash
```

It clones the repo to `~/keirouter`, installs everything, and starts the backend on `:20180` and the dashboard on `:5180`.

> Already cloned it? Just `make setup` from the project root and you're off.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option C — Docker</strong> · no Go/Node, no problem</summary>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mydisha/keirouter/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --docker
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option D — Docker Compose</strong> · ship it (VPS / production / Coolify)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mydisha/keirouter.git
cd keirouter
cp .env.example .env       # set KEIROUTER_MASTER_KEY before going to prod
docker compose up -d --build
```

VPS, PostgreSQL, and Coolify notes live in [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option E — Windows</strong> · prebuilt, no Go/Node needed</summary>

Open **PowerShell** and run:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mydisha/keirouter/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

It downloads the latest prebuilt binary, drops it (plus the dashboard) into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\KeiRouter`, and adds it to your PATH. Open a **new** terminal afterwards, then:

```powershell
keirouter -bootstrap   # mint your first API key (printed once)
keirouter start        # start the server on :20180
keirouter tray         # or run in background with system tray icon
```

> Pin a version or change the location with `$env:KEIROUTER_VERSION` / `$env:KEIROUTER_DIR` before running the one-liner.
</details>

### First login

| How you installed | Open this | Password |
|---|---|---|
| From source (quickstart / `make setup`) | http://localhost:5180 | `keirouter` |
| Homebrew / Docker / production | http://localhost:20180 or `http://YOUR_VPS_IP:20180` | `keirouter` |

> **Remote dashboard access:** Plain HTTP works for initial LAN/VPS access, but HTTPS is strongly recommended for production. Behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy, make sure it overwrites client-supplied `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `Forwarded` headers so KeiRouter can apply the `Secure` session-cookie flag correctly. See the [deployment guide](deploy/README.md) for configuration details.

It'll nudge you to change that password the second you log in (please do 🙏). Allergic to UIs? Mint a key straight from the terminal:

```bash
keirouter -bootstrap   # prints a kr_ key, once
```

### Connect your tools

In your AI tool of choice (Cursor, Claude Code, Cline, you name it), set:

- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:20180/v1`
- **API Key:** the `kr_` key from the dashboard or `-bootstrap`
- **Model:** a provider model like `openai/gpt-4o`, or the name of a fallback [chain](#-smart-routing-chains) you cooked up

That's it. You're routing.

---

## 💸 Token Savings (where the money hides)

Every request runs through a deterministic token-saving pipeline **before** it gets translated to the provider's format — so the savings work the same no matter which provider you land on. There are **five savers**, each independently toggleable from **Settings → Token Saving**, and a dashboard that shows you exactly how much you clawed back.

| Saver | Side | The pitch |
|---|---|---|
| **RTK / Slimmer** | Input | Shrinks chunky tool output (diffs, greps, listings, build logs) locally before it ever leaves your machine. |
| **Headroom** | Input | Routes request messages through an external [Headroom](https://github.com/headroomlabs-ai/headroom) proxy for deeper compression. *Fail-open* — if the proxy sneezes, your request sails through untouched. Also sniffs out "phantom savings" so only real wins get counted. |
| **Terse** | Output | Drops a concise-output directive so the model skips the small talk and gives you the goods. |
| **Caveman** | Output | Terse's stronger cousin (Wenyan / 文言文 levels included) — trims output tokens by 65–75%. |
| **Ponytail** | Output | Injects a "lazy senior dev" system prompt (`lite` / `full` / `ultra`) that nudges the model toward the smallest possible change. Stacks on top of Terse or Caveman. |

> Terse and Caveman both inject a system directive, so they're mutually exclusive — pick one. Ponytail happily layers on top of either.

**Pipeline order:** `normalizer → RTK → Headroom → Terse / Caveman → Ponytail → provider translation`.

### Getting Headroom running

Headroom is its own open-source compression proxy. KeiRouter just calls its `/v1/compress` endpoint, so you spin it up locally first. One gotcha worth shouting about: the **`headroom` CLI lives in the Python package** — the npm package is a library only, so `npm install -g headroom-ai` will leave you staring at `command not found`. Don't say we didn't warn you. 😉

```bash
# The clean way: pipx isolates the CLI and sorts out your PATH (needs Python 3.10+)
pipx install "headroom-ai[all]"
pipx ensurepath               # puts headroom on your PATH — then restart your shell

headroom proxy --port 8787    # start the proxy
headroom doctor               # make sure it's actually happy
```

On Ubuntu and `pip` is fighting you (PEP 668 blocks global installs)? Go `--user` and make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`:

```bash
pip install --user "headroom-ai[all]"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"   # drop this in ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
```

Then over in **Settings → Token Saving → Headroom**: flip it on, set the **Proxy URL** to `http://localhost:8787`, and hit **Test connection** to confirm the handshake. Green check? You're golden.

---

## 🧠 Smart Routing (Chains)

Why bet on one model when you can have a backup plan? Build a **chain** in the dashboard. Say you name one `coding`:

1. `openai/gpt-4o` — your first pick
2. `deepseek/deepseek-chat` — steps in if the first one rate-limits or face-plants

Then just set your app's model to `chain:coding` (or plain `coding`) and let KeiRouter sweat the failover.

---

## 🔌 It does more than chat

Chat completions are just the start. KeiRouter proxies the whole buffet:

| Capability | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Image generation | `/v1/images/generations` |
| Speech-to-text | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| Text-to-speech | `/v1/audio/speech` |
| Embeddings | `/v1/embeddings` |
| Web search | `/v1/search` |
| Web fetch | `/v1/web/fetch` |

---

## 🔑 Skip the keys: OAuth

Copy-pasting API keys gets old fast. Connect providers straight from the **Connections** page with OAuth — sign in once, and KeiRouter quietly refreshes your tokens in the background.

| Provider | Flow |
|---|---|
| **Claude** | Anthropic OAuth |
| **GitHub Copilot** | GitHub device flow |
| **Gemini CLI** | Google device flow |
| **KiloCode** | Custom device-auth |
| **Qoder** | PKCE device-token flow |
| **CodeBuddy** (Tencent) | Browser-poll flow |
| **Cursor** | Token import flow |

---

## 📋 Plans & Budgets

Plans are reusable budget policies you can stamp onto any API key — write the rules once, apply them everywhere. Each plan covers:

- **Spend limit** — USD cap (micro-dollar precision, because pennies add up)
- **Token limit** — max token usage
- **RPM / TPM / Concurrency limits** — per assigned key (`0` = unlimited)
- **Reset period** — `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or `total`
- **Allowed models** — wildcard patterns like `claude-*`, `gpt-4*` (empty = everything's fair game). Keys follow their plan's model list live, so editing a plan updates every key on it; set a per-key override only when a key needs a narrower list.
- **Alert threshold** — get pinged at 1–100% of budget
- **Hard cutoff** — block requests when the budget's gone, or just track and let it ride

Every tenant gets a default plan out of the box. Manage them on the **Plans** page and assign them in **Keys** settings.

---

## 🚦 Rate Limiting

Keep your gateway (and your upstream quotas) from getting hammered with per-key RPM, TPM, and concurrency caps. For a single-instance setup, the in-memory limiter is all you need:

```yaml
limits:
  enabled: true
  backend: memory
  default_rpm: 600
  default_tpm: 200000
  default_concurrency: 50
  window: 1m
  cleanup_interval: 1m
```

Those defaults only apply to keys **without** a plan. The moment a key has one, the plan's `rpm_limit`, `tpm_limit`, and `concurrency_limit` take over (`0` = unlimited).

---

## 🛡️ Guardrails

A built-in content-safety layer runs detectors against every request and response. Policies stack **global → provider → model → chain → API key** and merge at request time, so the most specific rule wins.

| Detector | Catches | Default engine | Optional engine |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PII** | Email, phone, credit card, IBAN, IP, URL, **NIK / NPWP / Indonesian passport** | Native Go (Presidio-compatible) | Microsoft Presidio HTTP sidecar |
| **Prompt Injection** | Ignore-previous, role override, DAN, prompt-leak, safety bypass | Native regex catalog | — |
| **Topics** | Allow-list / block-list of topics | Keyword + n-gram | Embedding similarity |
| **Toxicity** | Profanity, hate, harassment, violence, sexual (id + en) | Native catalog | OpenAI Moderation API |
| **Bias** (outbound) | Political, gender, ethnic, religious bias in responses | Native bilingual lexicon | — |

- **Actions:** `log_only`, `warn`, `mask` (rewrite it), or `block` (refuse it). Strictest action across detectors wins.
- **PII strategies:** `redact`, `replace`, `mask`, `hash`, `anonymize`, or `block`.
- **Streaming-safe:** a sliding 256-char buffer scans assistant output as it streams and pulls the plug mid-sentence if something leaks.
- **Observability:** every decision shows up in **Audit Logs** (live via SSE); Prometheus serves `keirouter_guardrail_decisions_total` and `keirouter_guardrail_eval_seconds` at `/metrics`.
- **Compliance:** a per-tenant `allow_external_engines` flag forces every detector offline; `KEIROUTER_GUARDRAILS__AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` controls retention; the test endpoint is capped at 10 req/min.

Starter templates ship in the dashboard's "From template" picker (Indonesia PII · Strict safety · Compliance audit · Public chatbot · Alerts-only), and you can export/import policies as a JSON bundle.

Want NER-based PII detection (`PERSON`, `LOCATION`, full multilingual)? Spin up the optional **Presidio sidecar**:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.postgres.yaml -f compose.presidio.yaml up -d
```

Then flip any PII policy's engine to `presidio` in the dashboard.

---

## 🎨 Make it yours: Branding

Rebrand the admin dashboard *and* the public Usage Portal from **Settings → Branding**:

- **App name** — swap "KeiRouter" for your own
- **Logo & favicon URLs** — your SVG/PNG, your vibe
- **Tagline** — the line on the portal login screen
- **Color palette** — `sage-terra`, `ocean`, `midnight`, and friends

---

## 🔧 CLI Tools Auto-Config

The **CLI Tools** page spits out ready-to-paste config snippets for the usual suspects:

> Claude Code · Cursor · Cline · GitHub Copilot · DeepSeek · KiloCode · OpenCode · OpenClaw · Hermes · JCode · Droid · CodeBuddy

Copy, paste into your tool's config, done.

---

## 🌐 Usage Portal

A dedicated, no-admin-required view at `/portal` where teammates keep an eye on their own usage — quota and spend, token usage over time, compression savings, and plan limits.

Sign-in is per user and Google-based:

1. Open `/portal` and click **Sign in with Google**.
2. On first sign-in, paste your full API key once to **claim** it. A key can be claimed by exactly one Google account.
3. From then on, signing in shows only your own usage dashboard.

No admin session is involved, and the portal session is isolated from the admin API — a portal cookie can never reach `/api/*`.

### Enabling Google SSO

Create an OAuth 2.0 **Web application** client in Google Cloud Console and register this authorized redirect URI:

```text
https://<your-host>/portal/auth/google/callback
```

Then enable it in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
portal_sso:
  enabled: true
  google_client_id: "<client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com"
  # optional: restrict sign-in to specific email domains
  allowed_domains: []
  # optional: defaults to <public-base-url>/portal/auth/google/callback
  redirect_url: ""
```

The client **secret** is never stored in YAML. Provide it via environment:

```bash
export KEIROUTER_PORTAL_SSO__GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<client-secret>"
```

Enabling SSO without a client id and secret **fails closed** — the server refuses to start rather than exposing the portal.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Out of the box, KeiRouter runs on an embedded **SQLite** database — zero config, zero fuss. Running it for a team? Switch to **PostgreSQL**: copy `config.example.yaml` and run with `-config`, or use environment variables like `KEIROUTER_SERVER__PORT=8080`. Docker/Coolify examples are in [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md).

---

## 🛠️ Architecture

Curious what happens after you hit send? Here's the life of a request:

1. **Gateway** — takes your HTTP request and figures out the dialect (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, …).
2. **Guardrails (inbound)** — runs PII / injection / toxicity / topics detectors; block → refuse, mask → rewrite the prompt on the spot.
3. **Pipeline** — runs the [token savers](#-token-savings-where-the-money-hides) (RTK → Headroom → Terse/Caveman → Ponytail) and checks your budget.
4. **Dispatch** — picks the best provider account and juggles fallbacks.
5. **Connector & Transform** — calls the provider, then translates the answer back into your tool's format.
6. **Guardrails (outbound)** — scans the response (or each stream chunk) for leaked PII, bias, or toxicity; block → cancel, mask → rewrite.
7. **Meter** — logs token usage and savings so the dashboard has something pretty to show.

---

## 🔒 Security

- The admin API (`/api/*`) only listens to localhost by default. Exposing it? Put it behind a reverse proxy and set a stable `master_key`.
- **Guard your master key with your life** — it's the root of trust for every encrypted credential.
- Credentials sit behind AES-256-GCM envelope encryption; the dashboard uses password auth + HMAC session cookies; outbound requests get SSRF protection.
